# This is the default branch. Its purpose is to explain where are which files and the differences between the branches

All branches (except this one obviously) have their files losslessly compressed. Additionally:

[PNG-only](https://github.com/RDKRACZ/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books-But-Images-Are-Optimized-And-In-Modern-Format/tree/PNG-only) has all its files in the PNG format (originally there were some JPGs).

[WEBP-only](https://github.com/RDKRACZ/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books-But-Images-Are-Optimized-And-In-Modern-Format/tree/WEBP-only) - all content is in the WEBP format.

[HEIF-only](https://github.com/RDKRACZ/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books-But-Images-Are-Optimized-And-In-Modern-Format/tree/HEIF-only), you guessed it.

[AVIF-only](https://github.com/RDKRACZ/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books-But-Images-Are-Optimized-And-In-Modern-Format/tree/AVIF-only) ...
